  This is a final project exploring several graph coloring algorithms and their applications on real life data-sets. In our project we wrote code for the Recursive Largest First, DSATUR , and Greedy algorithm for graph coloring problems. DSATUR v2 contains solely the code for the DSATUR algorithm and RLFGraphColoring contains the code for the RLF algorithm. In the Graph_Coloring_Data_Analysis file we preform a variety of analysis on all the different algorithms including their runtime and the quality of their results. The ColorAnalysis notebook evaluates the performance of each algorithm based on the number of colors that are used to color a graph.

  I worked on this project with Yael Homa and Zach Zerbe.
